# Dimensions of software architecture
**1. Architectural characteristics**

    Characteristics of the system to be designed.

    Whether the system will be performant, reliable, available?
    Is the system highly flexible and maintainable?

**2. Architectural decisions**

    Choices about the structure of the system.

    Whether the deployment will happen on cloud or on-premises?
    Which type of database to be chosen for the particular use-case?.

**3. Architectural styles**

    Choosing from one of the several styles prevalent in the market.
    Style also affects the characteristics of the system.

    Should the system be event-driven? Should it be micro-service based or n tiered?

**4. Logical components**

    Building blocks of the system.

    How the system is decomposed into basic structures which give body to the final work.

All these dimensions are inter-related and affect each other.


# Design vs Architecture

Whether a decision to be taken falls in design or architecture perspective?

*1. Whether the decision is strategical or tactical?*

    A strategical decision is mostly architectural, where as a tactical decision is mostly a design aspect.

*2. What level of efforts are required in executing that decision.*

    If executing or even making the decision takes significant efforts (days, weeks), it is mostly an architectural one.
    If decision making and execution is rather quick, then it is mostly a design aspect.

*3. What are the significance of trade-offs we are opting for while taking the decision?*

    If there are significant trade-offs involved while making a decision, then it is architectural.
    If there are no or relatively less trade-off, then it is design aspect.
